## Gamemodes:
Currently, our site contains of 3 targeted mini-games: WordWhiz, SwipeSight, SpellSafari. 
Each game targets a specific skill set or struggle that dyslexic kids commonly face in an interactive, fun way -- a way that allows them to feel normal 
while fighting the condition.

- WordWhiz displays a word for a certain amount of time and prompts the user to enter the word after it vanishes. As the user continues to play, our machine learning model, which utilizes the naive Bayes classification model, finds words that they have difficulty spelling or missing and suggests words that could contain similar patterns. This game targets reading, writing, and spelling difficulties, a major struggle of dyslexia.

- SwipeSight helps dyslexic children with memory retention by showing them three images and then presenting ten images, asking them to identify which ones were present in the original set of three. The user swipes right for new pictures and swipes left for familiar ones. This game primarily targets memory, which is one of the biggest issues for victims of dyslexia.

- SpellSafari is an adventure mini-game that targets language and phonological processing issues. Prompted with similar words, the user receives points if they choose the correct word and will continue to be prompted by such words as they advance levels and the words get harder to distinguish in a time constrain.

## Special Features:
To motivate kids to keep fighting these struggles, we implemented a collectible feature where kids can collect Dragon Cards, which help them unlock new levels and characters. To reward improving performance and consistent practice, each game rewards you more coins that allow them to purchase collectibles from the Shop.
