## Gamnemodes:
Currently, our site contains of 3 targeted mini-games: WordWhiz, SwipeSight, SpellSafari. 
Each game targets a specific skill set or struggle that dyslexic kids commonly face in an interactive, fun way -- a way that allows them to feel normal 
while fighting the condition.

WordWhiz displays a word for a certain amount of time and prompts the user to enter the word after it vanishes. As the user continues to play, our machine learning model, which utilizes the naive Bayes classification model, finds words that they have difficulty spelling or missing and suggests words that could contain similar patterns. 
This game targets reading, writing, and spelling difficulties, a major struggle of dyslexia.
